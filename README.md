# unsupervised_image_classification
Combining transfer learning and KMeans algorithmâ€™s for unsupervised image classification.
I used one of ResNet model hidden layers to provide some information about the images, then I used KMeans algorithm to classify images.

You can access the codes by going to code/main.ipynb , if you place images in test_images directory, you're images will be seperated and shown in category_images directory using this piece of code.
